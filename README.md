# Smart-Irrigation-System
An automated Irrigation System capable of turning water pump on/off by sensing moisture and other environmental factors.
## Objective of Project
• An effort towards providing a convenient, worry free,
energy & cost-efficient irrigation system to the farmers.
• A promising water conservation technique.
• Smart Irrigation system that senses the wetness of the
soil and accordingly waters the soil.
• Build a cost-efficient model.
• Easy to operate.
• Make lives of farmers easy.
• Use water efficiently.
• Instil importance of our diminishing resources to the
users and encourage them to spread the word.

# Methodology
This comprises of mainly four units.
1. Power supply unit
2. Input unit (sensing part)
3. Processing unit (logical analysis)
4. Implementing unit (where output will be experienced).

# Conclusion
After Analyzing above result and considering
social proofs and surveys, we concluded that,
this Implementation can be very useful for the
farmers.
